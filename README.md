# covid19preventionapp

Flutter app for preventing local covid-19 spread

## APP NAME GOES HERE

This application is intended to help communities in their eventual recovery from the Coronavirus
pandemic. As school campuses and other similar institutions reopen, it will be essential to proceed
with caution and ensure that any spread is halted in its early phases. The application collects
relevant information from users, makes it anonymous and keeps track of any potential patient zero's.
Through keeping track of what classes and public spaces the users share, the app can help relevant
authorities quickly act if an infection is confirmed so those potentially affected can take the
needed precautions.
